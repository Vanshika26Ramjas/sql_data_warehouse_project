# üèõÔ∏è Data Architecture
The Data Architecture for this project follows the Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver** and **Gold** layer
![Architecture model drawio](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14d4cae4-188f-4fed-bed7-11ae535283c8)

 1. **Bronze Layer**:- It stores the raw data as-is from the system. Data is ingested from the CSV files ito the SQL Server Database.
 2.  **Silver Layer**:- This Layer inclued the data cleasing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
 3.  **Gold Layer**:- House business-ready data modelled into a star schema required for reporting and analysis.
